I have a solid background in physics and using it in various contexts. Constant learning has always been part of my career and I am comfortable to learn and study domains of knowledge that are new to me and to combine them with what I have already learnt. My current focus is to grow further expertise in areas that need solutions provided by a combination of advanced mathematics, computational tools, and project-specific knowledge.
