Averages or means are used to summarize distributions of numbers and there are more than one kind. They give a representative value of the collection. 

## [Arithmetic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean)
is defined as:

$$AM=\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N} \Sigma_{i=1}^{N}x_i$$

This mean is suitable for quantities which adding them make sense. For example, the average of three containers of 1, 6 and 11 liters is a 6 liter container, meaning having three 6 liter containers have the same capacity as initial containers.

## [Geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean)
is defined as: 

$$GM=\bar{x}= \sqrt[N]{x_1x_2...x_N}$$

or 

$$\bar{x}=e^{\frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}ln(x_i)} $$

in which *ln* is the natural logarithm.
This average suits those values that make sense to be multiplied together such as growth factors. For example, consider a material with an initial length of L which grows with a factor of alpha for the first 1 Celsius of raised temperature and then with a factor of beta for the next 1 Celsius increase in the temperature, this material's grows after 2 Celsius increase in temperature to $$(1+\alpha)(1+\beta)L$$. The average growth factor per Celsius by the geometric mean is $$\sqrt{(1+\alpha)(1+\beta)}$$ while the arithmetic mean of $$\frac{(1+\alpha)+(1+\beta)}{2}$$ gives the wrong average since after applying it twice we do not get the total growth of $$(a+\alpha)(1+\beta)L$$.

## [Harmonic Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean)
is defined as: 

$$HM=\bar{x} = \frac{N}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{x_i}}$$ 

The harmonic average is suitable to make an average out of time constants. Consider two pumps each of which pump one liter of water in x and y minutes, respectively. To replace both of them with a single pump of the same output as both, we either get their individual pumping rates which are 1/x and 1/y liter per hour and use the arithmetic mean or using the harmonic mean we calculate the average of time constants x and y.

## Properties and Generalization  
One property of the above three averages, which are known as [Pythagorean means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_means), is [[1]] $$min \leq HM \leq GM \leq AM \leq max$$

Moreover, these averages can be generalized [[2], [3]] as power mean:

$$ M_{p}(x_1, ..., x_N)=(\frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}^{p})^{\frac{1}{p}} $$

for p equals zero, one, and minus 1 we get respectively the geometric mean, arithmetic mean, and harmonic mean.
The power mean itself can also be generalized further by the [f-mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-arithmetic_mean):

$$ \bar{x} = f^{-1}(\frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}f(x_i)) $$

For various choices of function *f* we get:
1. \$$f(x)=x^{m} \text{, power mean}$$
2. \$$ f(x)=x \text{, arithmetic mean}$$ 
3. \$$ f(x)=ln(x) \text{, geometric mean}$$ 
4. \$$ f(x)=1/x \text{, harmonic mean}$$

## Applications
One of the application of the geometric mean, or power mean, is noise removal, page 64 in [^1]:

_Various types of means can be used to calculate the background noise_
Using the power mean, further adjustments can be performed to get an average between the geometric mean and the harmonic mean.
