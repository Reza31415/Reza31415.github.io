[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) is a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) for Unix-like operating systems which allows interaction of a user with the OS via the command-line. Bash is also a scripting language allowing automation.
In this page, I provide a list of bash keywords that I have come to use with a brief description to serve as a wiki for myself. The list is not exhaustive, for a more thorough list [see here](https://ss64.com/).

## [echo](https://ss64.com/bash/echo.html)

Prints out messages to the terminal. It has several flags such as -e which allows it to interpret [escape sequences](https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildyourownCommandLinewithANSIescapecodes.html). Combining the flag -e with escape sequences we format the output of *echo* such as coloring it.
```shell
RED='\033[0;31m'
echo -e $RED"red text"
```

## [set](https://ss64.com/bash/set.html)

Resources:
1. [The Set Builtin (Bash Reference Manual)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html)
2. [Baeldung on Linux](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/set-command)
3. [unix.stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/233724/68721)

*set* is used to modify the behavior of the shell or bash by giving this command options, which there are many. If used without any options prints out all the variables and functions in the shell with their values.

### -e

```shell
set -e
```
exits the pipeline or script as soon as an error occurs.

### -o

The option *-o* accepts an argument specifying the exact desired behavior, for a list [look here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html). For example:
```shell
set -o pipefail
```
assigns a return-value for the pipeline or script. If all the commands run successfully the return-value is zero, otherwise it is the non-zero value of the last command run.
The above two commands can be combined as:
```shell
set -eo pipefail
```

### \-\-

Each bash script, command or function accept some positional parameters which they act upon.
The following command sets the current positional parameters to new positional parameters p1, p2, and p3 so that $1 is p1, $2 is p2 and so on:
```shell
set -- p1 p2 p3
```
The double dash, \-\-, will treat anything with a single dash, \-, (which usually indicates being an argument flag) as a positional parameter.
Not placing anything after \-\- unset all the positional parameters.
